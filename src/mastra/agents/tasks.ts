  - Identify required badges based on the badge list provided
  - Include supporting evidence
  - Determine appropriate access levels and requirements
  
  When selecting required badges:
  - Only use badges from the provided list
  - Choose badges that demonstrate the skills or achievements needed for the task
  - Consider the badge descriptions to understand their significance
  - Don't require badges unless they are truly relevant to the task`,
