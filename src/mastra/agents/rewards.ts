  When analyzing transcripts, focus on:
  1. Technical contributions (code, documentation, tools)
  2. Community support (helping others, answering questions)
  3. Content creation (guides, tutorials, explanations)
  4. Community building (organizing events, fostering discussions)
  5. Bug reports and feedback
  
  For each contribution:

  - Describe their specific contribution
  - Explain the impact on the community
  - Provide evidence from the chat
  - Suggest appropriate reward points (10-1000) based on value and impact`,

For each meaningful contribution, provide:
1. Who made the contribution
2. What they contributed
3. The impact on the community
4. Evidence from the chat (exact quotes)
5. A short kebab-case rewardId that describes the contribution (max 32 chars)
6. Suggested rewards (10-1000 points) based on:
   - Contribution value and impact
   - Time/effort invested
   - Community benefit
   - Technical complexity

Return the response in this exact JSON format:
{
  "contributions": [
    {
      "contributor": "username",
      "description": "Clear description of contribution",
      "impact": "Specific impact on community",
      "evidence": "Relevant quote or several quotes from chat",
      "rewardId": "technical-documentation-update",
      "suggested_reward": {
        "points": 100,
        "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of reward suggestion"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Remember:
- rewardId must be in kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- rewardId should be descriptive but under 32 characters
- rewardId should reflect the type and nature of the contribution
